With the @contextmanager the code up to the *yield* perpares the context and the code after it tears it down.\n",

It yields a lambda function that returns a tuple with the assigned label for a given *timing* instance and the corresponding calculation of the time interval.  Note that the sequential nature of the code that places the calculation *t1 - t0* above the declaration of *t1* forces us to see that the yielded lambda is deferred and that we are dealing with a closure.  The lambda retains access to t0 and t1 after it is returned to the caller and when the lambda is called, as shown later on, both perf_counter values are available."
