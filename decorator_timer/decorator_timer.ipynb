    "## A Decorator for Timing a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Python example *GeneratorContextManager*, the purpose of the context manager was to time the code wrapped by the manager.  In the *Python Cookbook, 3rd ed.*, timing is used as an example for both ContextManager and Decorator recipes.  Following on this, the following example tries to duplicate the earlier functionality but is a means to discover that the earlier GeneratorContextManager does a better job for the specific features there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary structural difference in the timed code is that the contextmanager works on a listing of code inside the *with* block whereas the decorator requires a defined function to be timed.  In the case of decorating a preexisting function, say from an imported library module, then the \"@\" syntax is replaced by calling the decorator directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following defines a decorator using time.perf_counter twice to calcuate the duration of the wrapped function call.  The wrapper function is additionally passed a keyword argument 'label', used subsequently to identify the results. In order to not pass the label argument to the wrapped function, it is saved and then removed just before the call.  It is not particularly elegant, but the alternatives are discussed below. "

In order to accomplish this with the decorator, an additional function which takes the decorator is first created and then used to wrap each of the functional calls.  This enables the ability to wrap a sequence of calls rather than only treating individual calls. \n",
