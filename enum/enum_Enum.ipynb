    "\n",
    "Enums were introduced into the standard library in Python 3.4 and are described in the official documentation as \"a set of symbolic names (members) bound to unique, constant values.\"  This could be extended to say that the members generally cover the concept at hand, exhausting that space with respect to the current application.  For instance, 'N E S W' would cover the cardinal directions for two-dimensional mapping.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of expressing this is to treat the members as categories or types from which objects in a system take on a distinct value.  In a relation database system, enums can simplify the data model while enforcing data integrity; no extraneous tables to manage such simple data values.  Of course, if one needs to change the enum members after the fact, then difficulties arise.  So it is best to be very sure that the enum is comprehensive and enduring. It is more flexible in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enum.Enum module has a variety of ways to assign a value to each name.  But it is sometimes the case that the application is never concerned with the value, just with the distinctness of members.  Uniqueness of the member is enforced via uniquess of the name.  Uniqueness of the values is optional but can be imposed with the @unique decorator.   \n"

    "A different take on expanding the enum is to use the Cartesian product of two Enums to create a new Enum for a 2-dimensional space.  Unlike the Planets example, the following *playing card* example avoids multiple fields in favor of simply structured strings for the values.  Unfortunately for playing cards, there is no good set of Python literals to represent them.  Using the unicode symbols or numbers as the first character for the *names* isn't valid (though it is currently possible to create the enum this way and print out as a list, they can't be individually referenced in code).  But using the symbols for display #values# can is useful here.  Passing a list of (name, value) tuples works in the functional API and the list comprehension here makes it succinct.    "

    "But if Poker is to be the context, then the enumeration of cards will need to be ordered and we will still need to have some display options.  So rather than use the *Functional API*, the following rewrite of the three *Enum*s uses tuples as the Enum values with an integer to provide the ordering values, a short display string, and for the cards the rank and suit.  For the cards, a custom Metaclass is used to define the Enum members which then enable the class definition format where the ordering interface is added.  Ethan Furman, the author of the enum module, said in a StackOverflow answer, \"Enums are not ordinary classes, and EnumMeta is not a typical metaclass\" and he cautions against using metaclasses, but its use here seems the direct route.
